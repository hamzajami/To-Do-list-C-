# To-Do-list-C++
A comprehensive C++ program implementing a versatile task management system. It includes multiple functionalities built using fundamental data structures like linked lists, stacks, queues, and binary search trees (BST). This project is ideal for learning and exploring data structure concepts in a practical application.
Functionalities:
- Login System: Secure user authentication with predefined usernames and passwords.
- Add Task: Add tasks to a queue (FIFO) for simple task management.
- Remove Task: Mark tasks as done by dequeuing from the front of the queue.
- Priority Task Management: Add and display tasks with priority using a priority queue implemented with a linked list.
- Undo Task Actions: Stack-based functionality to undo actions such as task addition or deletion.
- Task Organization with BST: Store and retrieve tasks by unique IDs in a binary search tree (BST).
- Display Tasks: View tasks in the queue, priority tasks, or tasks sorted by ID in the BST.
- Search Task by ID: Quickly search for a task in the BST using its ID.
